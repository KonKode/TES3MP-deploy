# TES3MP-deploy

### A script to simplify the installation and upgrade of TES3MP

<grimkriegor@krutt.org>

When placed in an empty folder this script creates a folder hierarchy, installs the system dependencies based on your distro, downloads the code for TES3MP, OSG, Bullet, RakNet and Terra, compiles everything and is also able to upgrade it from the latest git changes whenever necessary.

Config files and plugins are kept in a separate folder, avoiding their deletion during upgrades and rebuilds.

**Usage information:**

    ./tes3mp-deploy.sh --help

Can be used in conjunction with [TES3MP-forge](https://github.com/GrimKriegor/TES3MP-forge) to quickly create distributable packages that support a wide range of GNU/Linux distros.

Big thanks to Testman, Shnatsel, Shatur and the TES3MP community for their intense testing, debugging contributions and suggestions.

Additional gratitude to FreeAethernet and Joe for their relentless testing of the autogenerated packages.
